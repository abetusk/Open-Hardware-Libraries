Open-Hardware-Libraries
===

These are some open source hardware libraries mostly for use in MeowCAD.

Files have been converted and are available in this repository.  If you
want to do conversion yourself, make sure to intall [Eagle2Kicad](https://github.com/abetusk/Eagle2Kicad),
[www.meowcad.com](https://github.com/abetusk/www.meowcad.com) and [bleepsix](https://github.com/abetusk/bleepsix)
(and look at the source to figure out relative placement of source).

See each subdirectory for license information.  All licenses should be under some sort of free license (public
domain, CC-BY-SA, etc.).

All source code written by me should be considered under AGPLv3.
